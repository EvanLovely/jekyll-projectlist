# projectlist
### A tag plug-in for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/)

This plug-in introduces the new tag `projectlist` to Jekyll. It loads all files in the `_projects` directory and renders the entries into a single tag response, thus avoiding the creation of separate posts.


## Installation

Copy the files into your Jekyll directory.  
Additionally, you can configure the name and location of the projects source folder by setting  `projects_dir` in your Jekyll's `_config.yml`.
